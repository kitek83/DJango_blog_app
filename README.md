I built Blog application that allows users to create, edit and delete posts using Django Admin Panel.
The hompage will list all blog posts and there will be dedicated page for each individual blog post.
I used static files (base.css) and showed how Django works with static files.
I used DetailView for the 1st time to create detailed individual view of each blog post entry.
I built Blog application that allows for creating, reading, updating and deleting blog post without going to admin panel.
This functianolity is called CRUD - Create-Read-Update-Delete.
